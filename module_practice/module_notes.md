When a program requires multiple modules, it is best to organize these modules into packages. 
A package is a collection of multiple modules that are like-minded. 
This organization allows you to call the module from a package in the main program. 
This main package has a subpackage as well for further organization. 

Remember! Modules are basically lego pieces (of .py scripts and functions). Packages are the packs the lego pieces are seperated in. 
Finally all the packages and lego pieces within them come together in the main program script. 
All of which should be placed into a directory, like a complete lego set. 

Important! Each directory (package) needs a __init__.py file, which can be left empty.
