#Complete Python3 Bootcamp

This repository is my work for the Complete Python3 Bootcamp led by Jose Portilla found on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/

The code I commit is my own. The repository for the course notes can be found here: https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp

The file name includes the section (s#), name of exercise (ex) or project (pj), and the date I started. 

I am beginning with the Jupyter notebooks, I will commit .py files where I see fit.
